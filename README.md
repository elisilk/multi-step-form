# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I am completing this challenge as part of the [Introduction to front-end testing](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-front-end-testing-kacF_IJQO5) Frontend Mentor learning path. This continues my efforts to learn my chosen JS Framework - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/). And now my more specific goal for this challenge was to learn to incorporate [end-to-end tests](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-front-end-testing-kacF_IJQO5/steps/689e5149d98fffca3e5870a6/article/read).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### Continued development

Known issues - specific areas that the solution should be improved:

- [ ] Check that all ARIA is being used appropriately. Especially with respect to:
  - [ARIA: aria-invalid attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-invalid)
  - [ARIA: aria-errormessage attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-errormessage)

Feature requests - specific enhancements to make:
